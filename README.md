Curious about building fully-private AI agents? Look no further. This repo shows how you can integrate CrewAI with private LLMs deployed via Cloudera's AI Inference Service.

Check out the instructions available in the accompanying [blog](https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Community-Articles/Fully-Private-Agents-with-Cloudera-s-AI-Inference-Service/ta-p/400799).

To deploy, you will need the following:
* AI Inference Service Model Endpoint (excluding the "/chat/completions" suffix)
* Model Name

Once you deploy the AMP and run the setup steps, you can then the Jupyter notebook at ```1_private_ai_agents/private_agents.ipynb``` and run through each cell.
